# Maze
A program which generates random mazes using the depth-first search

![](maze.GIF)

## Technology Stack Used: 
- Made with SDL2, written in C

## Future Improvement or Features:
- Possibly add other algorithms for creating mazes because maze is not always solvable with this algorithm
- Use two demensional array for representing the board as it would be more effecient and reliable in regards such as checking if the neighbors are valid
